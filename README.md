1. Installation
    - **Install npm:** npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and makes it easy to update the code that youâ€™re sharing, so you can build amazing things ([link install](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)).  
    - **images-scraper:** This a simple way to scrape Google images using Puppeteer. The headless browser will behave as a 'normal' user and scrolls to the bottom of the page until there are enough results ([link repo](https://github.com/pevers/images-scraper)).  
    - npm install images-scraper
